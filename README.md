<h1> Overview of Exam Well </h1>

<h2>Handling NPM Dependencies</h2>

* ensure that you add the nodejs file into your environmental PATH variables (Ask GPT it can help)
* run `npm install` in the terminal of /ExamWell-24 to install all dependencies for NPM,

<h2>Backend python dependencies</h2>

* run `python3 -m venv .venv` in the terminal of /ExamWell-24
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the same terminal to install all backend dependencies.


<h2>How to Run</h2>

* Once all dependencies have been installed, start a virtual environment (venv) by typing `source .venv/Scripts/activate` in the terminal
* In /ExamWell-24 directory open terminal and type `cd backend` to move into /backend
* run app.py thorugh `python app.py` and split the terminal into 2 becuase we need this server running
* use the second terminal to change directories back to /ExamWell-24 with `cd ..` and move into /frontend through `cd frontend`
* there start the server with `npm run dev` and it should take you to the home page in your browser
